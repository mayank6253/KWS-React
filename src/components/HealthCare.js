            Blockchain technology is one of the most crucial and unruly
            technologies which industries are willing to adopt. The healthcare
            industry is pretty much interested in the blockchain technology and
            is soon going to adopt such technology.

            Compared to the other industries the blockchain industry is
            developing very slowly. In today's fast-moving world, the processes
            followed by the hospitals are old. It has been often stated by
            researchers that the industry lacks technology. The statement is
            quite contradictory to the fact that some of the most educated and
            skilled professionals work in this industry. How can anyone state
            that the medical world lacks innovation all around the globe? Well,
            most of the innovations have been done in this industry which in
            turn has increased the mortality rate and decreased the death rate.
            The world of medicine provides a new life to humans. If you take a
            closer look at this industry then you will soon find out that this
            industry is filled with vertical modernization. When it comes to
            horizontal modernization then there is a slight delay.

            What is the difference between vertical modernization and horizontal
            modernization?
          </h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Vertical modernization focusses on one particular aspect. Whereas
            horizontal modernization aims at fulfilling the desires of everyone.
            For example, Penicillin, Polio vaccine, and others help to diagnose
            a particular illness. This is an example of vertical modernization.
            On the other hand cloud computing, electricity, and many others can
            be used in a wide variety of fields. This is a wonderful example of
            horizontal modernization. Many of the hospitals still prefer using
            pen and paper to jot down patient's history and other things. This
            indicates that they are still using vertical modernization and they
            will take time to adopt horizontal modernization.

            The data recorded in a blockchain remains unchanged and is handled
            by a network of computers. The computers are not owned by any
            individual or business firm. All the blocks of data are chained with
            one another and they protected. The blockchain has gained immense
            popularity among business houses. This is because the processes
            followed by the blockchain are decentralized in nature and there is
            no third party involved. The storage of data is cryptographical in
            nature. As the blockchain is unchangeable therefore no one has the
            right or the access to get a hold of the data. The data stored
            within the blockchain can be stored.

            How is blockchain a decentralized process?
          </h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Decentralization is transparent in nature. Moreover, it brings in
            trust in the minds of the users. In the earlier days, humans lived
            in caves for their survival. None trusted on one another. When a
            human saw the chances of he or she being killed living in the wild
            then they learnt to trust one another. Therefore, started living in
            a community. With time, the trust factor evolved in a variety of
            ways. The barter system was our first system of exchange. It was not
            a very complex process. As time progressed business became complex.
            People began trusting on banks rather than on other individuals. As
            time moved on banks started failing in their nature of business. The
            customers started losing faith which ultimately led them to search
            for an online platform which would take care of financial
            transactions. The data accumulated inside the blockchain is stored
            in numerous storage spaces. Several computers operate within the
            network which holds all the copy of the saved data. If anything is
            upgraded within a blockchain then every node receives a notification
            for that.

            Interoperability in the healthcare industry

          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Interoperability is a complex situation in the healthcare industry.
            Over the years patients as well the authorities are facing a serious
            complexity when it comes to interoperability. Recognizing patients
            is a conflicting situation when it comes to interoperability. In
            addition to this, the information remains blocked due to useless
            interoperability.

            Dissatisfaction with recognizing patients

          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Since times immemorial there is no absolute guide to recognize
            patients. International bodies have been working on this for decades
            now. So the healthcare authorities thought of introducing electronic
            health records for patients. Such a system in the earlier days has
            led to ultimate chaos and patients were left ill-treated.
