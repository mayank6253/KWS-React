            In the year 2008, Blockchain came into existence. Bitcoin was the
            first digital cryptocurrency. As time passes by innumerable
            industries are recognizing the advantages of blockchain technology.
            The finance industry is getting the hang of the importance of
            blockchain technology.

        <div className="team-container-content">
          <div className="paragraph">
            A blockchain is a technology in which a series of changeless data is
            stored and handled by a set of devices. None of the blockchains is
            owned by a single business firm. The blocks of data which are also
            known as blocks are guarded and chained to one another using chains.
            The main reason why blockchains have gained so much of importance is
            that the entire process is decentralized. The database stored is
            completely secured and none has any access to it. None can touch the
            data as the data is unchangeable. As it is transparent, therefore,
            keeping a track of the data becomes next to impossible.

          <h4 className="cf-software">
            What is the three main support system of blockchain technology?
          </h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Before Bitcoin and BitTorrent were introduced the entire process was
            centralized in nature. Centralization means that if you are a user
            then you can gain access to anyone's data by seeking permission from
            the single entity. Banks can serve as the best example of the
            centralized process. If you require transferring an amount to a
            party then you are required to consult the bank. Another example of
            the centralized process can be when you ask for queries from Google
            then you are asked to wait. Google gets back to you by retrieving
            information from the server. Though the process is serving people
            for years it has been causing serious damage to the society at
            large. This is because all the data series are saved and protected
            in one server. It's an easy job for hackers to gain access to all
            these crucial data. There is no system up-gradation as such. If
            there was any then the entire process would have stopped. When a
            centralized entity closes down then there is no way of retrieving
            crucial data. If any centralized institute is corrupted then it
            loses all access to the data. This is a serious threat to users. On
            the other hand, when it comes to the decentralized process then the
            data is not securely accumulated within one single organization.
            Within a decentralized network if you want to connect with any of
            your friends then you can do so immediately from your own space.
            This is the main concept behind the invention of Bitcoins. Do you
            want to transfer money to a relative? Well, that's an easy task. You
            can do so from your comfort zone.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Unchangeability Changelessness means that once something has been
            fed into the blockchain network then the data is unchangeable. None
            can mess with the data entered. How many fraud cases can be curbed
            in the financial sector if this process is followed? If a hacker
            gets to know that the data is unchangeable then a lot of customer’s
            money can be saved. This is the main reason why cryptographic hash
            function came into existence. Hashing refers to the grasping of an
            input string of any width and producing an output of a particular
            width. In the process of hashing, it doesn't matter how long your
            input is but your output has a permanent length. In such a situation
            none is required to remember the input as the length can be very
            long. You must be aware of the output which is particular in width.
            This makes mentoring easier.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Avalanche Effect This is a property of the cryptographic hash
            function. When you make minor changes in the input even then you are
            bound to receive an output massive in nature. For example, there are
            three blocks and each block contains a set of data. If a hacker
            tries to tamper with the data in block three then the output
            produced will result in unimaginable results. This is turn is bound
            to affect block 2 and then block 1. The entire chain is now broken
            and dismantled. This is exactly how the blockchain technology
            attains stability.

          How is blockchain affecting the finance industry?
        </h3>
        <div className="hyper">
          <p className="lending">
            People are finding it difficult to transfer money internally within
            a bank. The average time taken to transfer within the same bank can
            cost you 2 to 5 working days. Now, this is truly insane. This is a
            huge concern in the 21st century. Innumerable people are working in
            remote areas and their salary is given to them by making a bank
            transfer. Most of the time, the money doesn't reach on time. If you
            are a freelancer, by any chance, then you will know the real pain.
            The bank to bank SWIFT transfers can cost you a lot of time. PayPal
            is the worst medium of sending and receiving money. Why does this
            happen? If the company is releasing the pay on Thursday then it
            reaches you on Monday because banks remain closed on weekends. The
            process takes a long time because the system is centralized.
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            Blockchain, on the other hand, is a decentralized procedure and it
            doesn't involve any form of a centralized institute. Moreover, all
            the processes are conducted by the users themselves and therefore
            both time and money are saved. The transactions are completed within
            seconds, unlike banks which take up to 2 to 5 days.
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            Where do you think a financial institute gives up a lot of money?
            Well, it's nowhere else than complying with the Know Your Customer
            (KYC) regulations. £40m is spent by a financial institute every year
            on an average for KYC Compliance. The cost can also go up to £300m.
            J.P. Morgan has spent a large sum of £1.6 billion on its compliance
            department. In addition to this, 13,000 people have been employed to
            monitor regulatory transformations. Employees working in the
            corporates stated that bringing clients on board can take up to 2
            months. Why don’t banks shift from this offline procedure of
            transactions? This is because some changes or the others are always
            coming up when it comes to complying with regulations. Other than
            that, most of the banks still make use of the traditional paper
            system. The procedure of compliance is done but by using papers.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            As reports state that there are innumerous parties that are involved
            in trade finance. Due to a large number of parties involved in the
            process, the entire procedure becomes destructive and sluggish. The
            general tendency of the parties lies in mistrust which results in
            the involvement of central institutes. Smart Contracts in blockchain
            can resolve such a critical issue.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Conclusion The blockchain technology and the financial industry can
            go hand in hand once the obstacles are removed from its path. If the
            benefits of blockchain technology are taken into consideration then
            the financial industry can gain a lot.
