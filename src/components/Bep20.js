          <h4 className="bitcoin"> What is the Binance smart chain</h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is the fastest and most affordable EVM
            blockchain right now. Through our BEP20 token generator, you can
            create an ERC20 compatible token on a much faster network with
            minimal transaction fees. BEP20 token development is done with the
            Solidity smart contract language which means that your token can be
            deployed on any blockchain that supports Ethereum Virtual Machine
            (EVM). Unlike Ethereum, the Binance Smart Chain runs on a
            Proof-of-Stake network which makes it much faster and
            cost-efficient.
          </p>
          <h4 className="bitcoin">How does BSC work?</h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            BSC works similarly to the Ethereum network with the exception that
            it uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. This means that you
            can use our BEP20 token generator to create tokens quickly with much
            lower transaction costs. The PoS system makes transactions extremely
            fast and reduces gas fees to a great extent.

            BEP20 tokens are smart contracts that can reside on the Binance
            Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain network. They are compatible with
            Ethereum’s EVM and can be deployed using the Remix IDE or a
            framework such as Truffle.

            The Binance blockchain network as a whole consists of 2 Blockchains,
            the Binance Chain and the Binance Smart Chain. These blockchains run
            in parallel to each other where BEP2 is the standard for Binance
            Chain and BEP20 works on Binance Smart Chain. The Binance Chain
            deals with payments and monetary tokens while the Binance Smart
            Chain supports smart contracts.
