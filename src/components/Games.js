            Mario video games in the year 1981 became very famous among the game
            lovers by the name of Jumpman. In today’s world the Donkey Kong
            became popular globally and is considered as one of the most
            favourite games of the Nintendo lovers. In fact, the game underwent
            many upgrades. Computer graphics have really won the hearts of
            millions.
            <br />
            Graphics has gone beyond just technological advancements. With the
            growth of the smartphone culture, mobile gaming came into view.
            Users started playing their favourite games even if they are at
            work. A researcher working for a blockchain technology company has
            recently said that what can be better when you have your favourite
            game handy on your mobile phone. In the year 2018, Asia’s mobile
            gaming industry received an annual revenue of US$41.5 billion.
            Researchers claimed that the next step of the gaming industry
            revolves around blockchain technology. It is going to be far more
            profitable than what the industry has earned till date.

          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            The gaming industry is not new to the blockchain technology but it
            is still at its elementary stage. There are various kinds of games
            built on the blockchain technology which are earning a good deal
            amount in the current market. CryptoKitties is the most famous and
            demanded game on the blockchain network. CryptoKitties is an
            authentic game which allows players to purchase, breed and deal in
            digital kittens with the help of cryptocurrency. The game was
            launched in October 2017 and only after three months, it earned a
            profit of US$12 million. The full version of the game wasn't kept
            live for more than a week.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            In the blockchain technology, game developers are not the only
            person who can take advantage of the system. The players can also
            earn profits. The game CryptoKitties allowed players to encash their
            tokens by selling their kittens to other players. Once the number of
            kittens doubled in number the players can sell those to other
            players. Games such as this give away a place for the players to
            make money as well. Developers do not have the right to produce
            virtual money. Non-fungible tokens are authentic in its own nature.
            It is next to impossible to make an image of such tokens because
            they possess a unique address on the blockchain network.

            The game developers and the gamers are receiving vast advantages
            from the blockchain technology. The main problem with this
            technology is that there is a scarcity for unique circulation
            channels for the games stored in the network. Most of the games on
            the network are web games but a large number of gamers prefer
            playing their favourite games using their mobile phones. The main
            problem is that the Google Play and the Apple Store do not allow
            circulation of mobile games to the customers which are
            cryptocurrency in nature.
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            At the same time. The blockchain technology is still in its growing
            years. The fact must be forgotten that it is unable to support a
            vast amount of transactions. Web games can easily let users play
            heavily stored games. CryptoKitties made a sales of US$12 million
            and soon after the app crashed because it was unable to support so
            many users. Blockchain technology can be a disastrous place for
            non-crypto users. The user interface is not very pleasing. Moreover,
            only a small number of blockchain lovers are let inside the network.
            Using blockchain is not like flying a plane. Its something like the
            PayPal while logging in. If you want to transact a certain amount
            then you require typing the person’s email id and it is done.
