          <p className="tm-para">
            The concept of insurance has its existence since ancient times.
            Almost every generation has used the insurance concept to control
            the effects of damages. Much has changed over the years; the
            development of technology has brought some major shifts in the
            present world but the insurance sector remains backdated. Despite of
            having various online insurance options, many people still prefer
            going to agents and get their insurance right. As significant
            improvements are being made in the sector, the introduction of
            blockchain or disruptive ledger is revolutionary. It uses advanced
            cryptographic techniques to create a safe and secure place for data
            that prevents window dressing and improves transparency. A
            blockchain can record anything from physical to digital assets, once
            a transaction is carried out it is grouped and then protected in an
            online block which is available on a larger global network, to which
            only authorised parties can get access to.

            Problems in introduction of blockchain in insurance market
          </h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Though the idea is a win-win to both parties, its introduction in
            the market isn’t easy and the insurances are bound to many
            complications and legalities making it completely cloud and block
            based is risky. The blockchain technology still cannot overcome the
            legal and regulatory hurdles. Moving toward a blockchain - backed-up
            insurance industry can be a distant dream but companies like Allianz
            and Swiss Re and various new start-ups are finding a solution.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            From the perspective of an industry as a whole, insurance companies
            have to align around standards and limitations within the blockchain
            technology. While this system can provide insurers with better means
            for collaborating and sharing data, the insurers themselves should
            be willing to work together. The technology itself must also be
            developed further and shall overcome the existing hurdles. Public
            blockchains, where each transaction on the ledger is visible and
            accessible to everyone, are unfeasible for the industry due to
            privacy and security concerns. Private, active and permissioned
            blockchains are yet to be developed.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Lastly, the insurance industry is highly regulated to safeguard
            customers from abuse and cannot risk breach of data. Legal and
            regulatory frameworks for insurance services need to evolve and
            provide proper framework for this technology to bring it to
            practice.

        <div className="hyper">
          <p className="lending">
            The key advantage of introducing this technology is data security
            and it can also create a clear audit trial. Also, as blockchain
            system are unchangeable and does not require oversight by any
            central authority, use of a distributed ledger creates new path for
            much secured collaborations between competitors by removing the
            qualitative aspect of trust between third party organisations The
            other advantages are
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            Insurances require a lot of red tapism, it creates delays and makes
            the parties lethargic. The blockchain technology will fasten up the
            process.
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            It not only would create hassle free sign up for the policyholder
            but also would make the document verification process for the
            insurer easier.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Since, everything is handled in real time, all the important dates
            related to the insurance would be updated timely. It will make the
            claim process simpler and smoother for both parties. Hence, a system
            would be developed where claims are managed, verified and paid
            quickly.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            When everything is online and real-time the chances of fraud are
            automatically reduced. No party can cheat on the other and
            therefore, a trust and goodwill factor is always maintained.
