          <div className="paragraph">
            Decentralized Finance (DeFi), also called Open Finance Development,
            is one of the most revolutionary concepts that blockchain technology
            brings to the table. It literally brings the power to the people by
            making major financial functions such as lending, borrowing, risk
            management, trading, and investments, more accessible to everyone
            inside a decentralized environment.

            We as a DeFi development company are here to provide you with the
            most innovative DeFi solutions that technology can offer. What we do

            blockchain. All that sounds nice, but let’s dig a little deeper.

        <div className="hyper">
          <p className="lending">
            Transparent Protocols Decentralized finance applications have
            protocols running on public blockchain ledgers. This ensures high
            levels of transparency that traditional systems cannot deliver.
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            Global Access The Decentralized finance applications we develop
            completely function online and are accessible by anyone from any
            part of the world.
          </p>

          <p className="lending">
            Permissionless Running on public “permissionless” blockchain
            ledgers, our Decentralized Finance applications are available to
            everyone. There is no economic segregation for the users, all they
            have to do is create an account and activate their wallet.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Programmability This refers to the high level of flexibility DeFi
            App development provides, allowing for easy creation of smart
            contracts.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Self-Custody Self-custody or non-custody means that no one other
            than yourself can take the funds in your wallet. It makes it safe
            from even hackers trying to swipe money from users, while still
            allowing smart contracts to use your funds for lending, exchanges,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Money Legos The ideology is based on the popular kid’s toy legos
            where you construct different structures with the same legos. In
            DeFi App development, legos refer to the process of developers
            building innovative new decentralized finance applications on the
            same blockchain baseline. This allows for high levels of
            composability and collaboration between different projects.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Immutability All data is stored in the immutable storage of the
            blockchain ledger, which means that no data is ever lost or tampered
            with.
          </p>
          <p className="lending">
            Easy Customization and integration with third-party apps Since
            Decentralized Finance applications are built on blockchain and the
            Lego ideology, it can be easily customized and integrated with
            third-party blockchain applications.
