        <p className="lending">
          Fast Transactions TRON token development allows you to leverage the
          fast transaction speeds the TRON blockchain has to offer. The TRON
          blockchain was built on top of the Ethereum source code, with
          additional tweaks to make the platform faster and more cost-efficient.
          By creating a token using our TRON token development services, you get
          transaction speeds upto 2000 TPS. This eliminates network congestion
          and high transaction costs that you usually find on platforms like
          Ethereum. All of this, while being completely compatible with the
          Ethereum blockchain and its “ERC” token standards. Get your TRON token
          development services today with BlockchainX
