            Think about the foreign exchange market where you can trade
            different currencies. You might have heard of it by the name of
            Forex, FX, or currency market. Forex is by far the largest market in
            the world in terms of trading volume and millions of people trade on
            it every day. An OTC Cryptocurrency exchange is the same thing but
            with, yes, you guessed it, cryptocurrencies.

          <h4 className="bitcoin">Bitcoin OTC trading is really opaque</h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Generally, when you trade traditional currencies, there has to be a
            certain level of transparency to the transactions. But Bitcoin
            trading on an OTC trading software lets you privately exchange coins
            with other users, hassle-free.

          <h4 className="platform">OTC Exchange Platform Development</h4>
          <p className="paltform-para">
            We’ve been providing high-end software solutions to businesses
            around the world for years now and we understood a long time ago
            that Blockchain technology and crypto were the future. That’s
            exactly why we decided to come forward as an OTC exchange
            development company and started working on our own OTC trading
            software. BlockchainX OTC trading software is the perfect solution
            for crypto start-ups looking to launch such a platform and the only

          All traders on our OTC trading software have to submit their KYC
          information before they can make any transaction. This KYC is then
          stored on the immutable storage of the blockchain ledger and can be
          easily verified by anyone on the platform.
