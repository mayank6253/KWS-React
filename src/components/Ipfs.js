          What is the Interplanetary File System (IPFS)?
        </h4>

        <div className="team-container-content">
          <div className="paragraph">
            The full form of IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. It is a
            transcripted file system which has the capability to securely
            accumulate files and keep on mentoring various versions of it with
            the passage of time. The movement of files within a network can be
            seen in IPFS. The perfect example of a distributed system of file is
            BitTorrent. If there are two parties and they are willing to
            exchange the data among themselves then they need a common set of
            rules and regulations. Such rules and regulations are generally
            termed as communication protocols.

          <h4 className="bitcoin"> Why IPFS?</h4>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            IPFS is a widely used platform. Moreover, it is highly secured and
            protected. The distribution of data is even with lesser inactivity
            for the benefit of the users.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            Files can be shared among different users without any fear of it
            getting hacked as they are encrypted.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            At the same time, innumerable files can be securely stored without
            any tension that it won't be updated.
          </p>
          <p className="bitcoin-para">
            In addition to this, it also serves as a social platform which is
            hugely considered to serve the purpose of the next generation.

        <h3 className="advantage">How Business grows with IPFS</h3>
        <div className="hyper">
          <p className="lending">
            Businesses involved in creating content for websites can earn huge
            profits if they are using the IPFS. A vast quantity of data can be
            delivered to the users without much of a hassle. Service providers
            are also able to achieve the same. When content is passed onto the
            customers in order to grab their attention then it is sent via a
            centralized medium. As IPFS is a decentralized file-sharing system
            the content reaches out to a large number of people without spending
            much on advertising and marketing campaigns.
          </p>
          <h3 className="advantage">How IPFS works?</h3>
          <p className="lending">
            When all the devices on the network are connected with the identical
            file architecture then IPFS works in a smoother way. What will you
            do to read a normal IPFS whitepaper? The very first step involves
            typing in a URL. The IP address is then decided to recognize the
            situation of the file. In most of the cases, it is the IPFS servers.
            After this, the client establishes a connection with the host and
            receives the file. Now if the network is that of an IPFS. The
            cryptographic hash identifies the file and the blocks.
